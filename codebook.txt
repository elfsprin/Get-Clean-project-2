Activity  factor
        Activity performed by the Subject during the observation.

        WALKING
        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        SITTING
        STANDING
        LAYING

Measurement  factor
        Subjects wore a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the experimenters aptured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

        In this dataset, only Measurements taking the mean or standard deviation have been included. X, Y and Z refer to the X, Y and Z axis. Measurements take Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration or Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
